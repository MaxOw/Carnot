# Carnot

Carnot is a haskell 2d game engine underneath the
[RuneSlayer][github-runslayer]. Currently it's a really messy bag of different
experiments and shortcuts.

You can use it as a whole, but it would probably be better to simply copy
anything you'd like. There is zero documentation and it will all change
substantially in the future so don't build anything serious with this.

# License

You can use everything in this repository however you please without any
restrictions. If you mention me as an author that's nice, if not tough luck.
So basically MIT, BSD3, CC0, choose what you like.
